FX Value Strategy development using CPI index and Spot, Futures FX data ranging from 2000 to 2025. 
After performing In-Sample analysis, and applying modern Quantitative Strategies techniques such as volatility normalisation, momentum and threshold filters, and signal analysis to optimise the performance, the Sharpe ratio came down to **0.319** and **0.280** for Out of sample analysis and maximum drawdown has not exceeded 5%, which suggests on a low=risk strategy to add diversity to the portfolio and trading based on macro indicators. 

A quick walkthrough on what was done:
 • A signal has been generated by looking at the current

 • The raw signal has generated a Sharpe of -4.3

 • After applying normalisation techniques and various filtering methods to avoid weak signals and momentum-driven behaviours of the market, but rather concentrating on the fundamentals, I have achieved a ratio of 0.319.

 • A Lead/Lag and Jackknfe test performed to test the validity of the answers

• An out-of-sample signal with the same filters(3 month momentum and signal strength over 0.2% misvaluation) has been applied. Furthermore, histogram for IS and OOS returns, along with the bootstrap analysis for OOS to validate that returns are within a 95% confidence band  using Monte-Carlo simulation - 200 bootstrap samples for 5 years (2021-2025) has been computed
